Task 2: Preparing for Sentiment Analysis.
As the code executes, the story of your sentiment analysis project takes an essential turn. You've embarked on the crucial task of data cleansing, just like the meticulous editing process in filmmaking, 
ensuring that every scene is flawless.

This code plays a vital role in this narrative. It's the scene where you remove any rows with missing values, ensuring your dataset is pristine. Just as a director trims unnecessary shots, you're trimming 
the data for a more focused analysis.

Task 3: Visualizing Sentiments.
In this cinematic data voyage, your code paints a vivid picture of Amazon product ratings. Like a masterful film director, you've harnessed Seaborn and Matplotlib to create a compelling visualization. The pie 
chart showcases the distribution of ratings, providing a snapshot of customer sentiment. It's a pivotal scene in our narrative, offering a visually striking revelation to our audience. Just as a film's visuals 
set the stage for the climax, this chart teases the sentiments that will shape the rest of our data analysis. With this artful presentation, we are now primed to delve deeper into the world of Amazon product 
reviews.

Task 4: Exploring Amazon Product Reviews.
In this pivotal chapter of our sentiment analysis journey, you've harnessed NLTK's SentimentIntensityAnalyzer to unveil the intricate emotions within Amazon product reviews. Just as a skilled director uncovers 
the depths of their characters, you've introduced "Positive," "Negative," and "Neutral" columns, providing a multidimensional perspective to the narrative. These columns serve as the main characters in our data 
story, capturing the sentiment nuances within each review.

As you continue to sculpt the dataset, it transforms into a dynamic character, ready to disclose the rich tapestry of emotions hidden within Amazon's treasure trove of reviews. This endeavor is akin to 
revealing a thrilling plot twist, making each review a unique element in the story. Stay tuned for the unfolding chapters, as we delve deeper into the world of sentiment analysis, shedding light on the 
uncharted territories of customer sentiment in e-commerce.

Task 5: Unmasking Amazon's Dominant Emotion.
In this project's defining moment, your code performs an emotional symphony, summing up the sentiments found within Amazon product reviews. Like a masterful film's climax, you've skillfully identified the 
dominant sentiment category, be it positive, negative, or neutral.

The variable 'sent' stands as the revelation, embodying the majority sentiment among these reviews, adding an exhilarating twist to our data journey. It's akin to uncovering the protagonist of a thrilling tale.

With this critical insight in hand, your narrative takes a bold step towards understanding the overarching sentiments within Amazon's vast sea of reviews, much like a movie unveiling the grand theme at its 
core. This is the turning point, and the ensuing scenes promise to be both enlightening and captivating.

# --- WRITE YOUR CODE FOR TASK 5 ---
# sentiment = ...
x = df['Positive'].sum()
y = df['Negative'].sum()
z = df['Neutral'].sum()
​
# compare the sums to determine the overall sentiment
if x > y and x > z:
    sentiment = 'Positive'
    
if y > x and y > z:
    sentiment = 'Negative'
    
else:
    sentiment = 'Neutral'
